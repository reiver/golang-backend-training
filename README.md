# Golang Backend Training
by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

-----

This is a guide to help train someone to do **backend development** using the Go programming language.

**This is NOT a tutorial. This is a guide that directs someone to learn specific things.**

The whole point of this guide is that _you_ go and learn what you need to learn to be able to complete each assignment in this guide.

If you can accomplish all these tasks, you will have _a lot_ of the skills necessary to do **backend development** using the Go programming language.

This guide gives you hints. And you should spend a bit of time trying to figure out stuff yourself. **BUT DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME BEING STUCK. ASK FOR HELP IF YOU GET STUCK!**

## 0. PREFACE

Do NOT skip any sections.

Do all sections. And do all the sections in the order that they appear in this guide.

Also, the point of this is that you show your work to someone more experienced with the Go programming language, so that they can give you feedback, tips, etc, so you can learn Go faster.

## 1. Outputting

### 1.1. Create a Go program that outputs text

Create a Go program that outputs the text:
> Hello world!

Hints:
* [fmt.Println()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Println)
* [installing Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* [getting started with Go](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started)

### 1.2. Hello {NAME}

Create a Go program that takes a name from a variable:
```Go
var name string = "Joe"
```
Or:
```Go
var name string = "Fred"
```
Or whatever.

And outputs a message such as:
```
Hello Joe!
```
Or:
```
Hello Fred!
```
Or whatever, depending on the value of the `name` variable.

Hints:
* [fmt.Printf()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Printf)

## 2. Logging

### 2.1. Create a simple logger

In this section you will №1 create a logger, and then №2 create a (very simple) program that uses that logger.

(Loggers let programmers record information about events.)

The program you will create (that uses that logger you created) will log the following:—

At the beginning of the program it logs:
> BEGIN

At the end of the program it logs:
> END

And it will look something like:
```
package main

func main() {
    log.Begin()
    
    log.End()
}
```

The logger you create will be represents by a type:
```
type Logger struct {
    //@TODO: you will need to figure out what goes here.
}
```

This logger will provide methods to output text BUT you will write it in a way that you have the ability to turn on and off the outputted text, and decide where you want the output to go.

The first method your logger will have is:
```
func (receiver Logger) Log(a ...interface{}) {
    //@TODO:  you will need to figure out what goes here.
}
```
The other two methods your logger will have are:
```
func (receiver Logger) Begin(a ...interface{}) {
    //@TODO:  you will need to figure out what goes here.
}
```

```
func (receiver Logger) End(a ...interface{}) {
    //@TODO:  you will need to figure out what goes here.
}
```

These other two methods should use the `Log()` method (you created before) to do their outputting.


Hints:
* [fmt.Fprintln()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Fprintln) — `fmt.Fprintln()` is similar to `fmt.Println()` except `fmt.Fprintln()` lets you tell it where to send the output.
* [os.Stdout](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#Stdout) — `os.Stdout` is where `fmt.Printf()` & `fmt.Println()` send their output.
* [ioutil.Discard](https://golang.org/pkg/io/ioutil/#Discard)
* [io.Writer](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer)

### 2.2. Hello {NAME} with logging

Copy your previous _Hello {NAME}_ program, but make it also log the name.

For example, if `name == "Joe"`, then it out log:
> The name was "Joe"

Alternatively, for example, if `name == "Fred"`, then it out log:
> The name was "Fred"

Etc.

To accomplish this you should add another method to your logger:
```
func (receiver Logger) Logf(format string, a ...interface{}) {
    //@TODO:  you will need to figure out what goes here.
}
```

Such that when you log the name you do a:
```
log.Logf("The name was %q", name)
```

Hints:
* [fmt.Fprintf()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Fprintf)

### 2.3. Repository "go-log"

Create a new publicly accessible repository named `go-log`.

If you are on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and your username is `joeblow`, then you would create:
```
https://github.com/joeblow/go-log
```

If you are on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and your username is `homersimpson`, then you would create:
```
https://bitbucket.org/homersimpson/go-log
```

If you are on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) and your username is `commanderkeen`, then you would create:
```
https://gitlab.com/commanderkeen/go-log
```

Etc.

### 2.4. Pacakge "log"

Put your logger code into the `go-log` repository you previously created.

### 2.5. import "go-log"

Write a program that uses your `"log"` package.

At the beginning of the program log:
> BEGIN

At the end of the program log:
> END

## 3. WEB SERVER

### 3.1. Create a Web server

Create a Web server in Go, where the Web server outputs:
> Hello world

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "net/http"](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)

### 3.2. Web Hello {NAME}

Make the API end point `/hello?name=REPLACE_ME` output the following:

`/hello?name=Joe`
```
Hello Joe
```


`/hello?name=Stan`
```
Hello Stan
```
Also include logging.

Hint:
* [fmt.Fprintf](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Fprintf)
* [http.Handler](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler)
* [http.ResponseWriter](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter)

### 3.3. Output JSON

Make the Web server you wrote in Go output the JSON:
```json
{
    "msg":"Hello world!"
}
```

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "encoding/json"](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/)

### 3.4. Web Hello {NAME} with JSON

Copy your previous _Web Hello {NAME}_ program, but make it output JSON:


I.e., make the API end point `/hello?name=REPLACE_ME` output the following:

`/hello?name=Joe`
```json
{
    "msg":"Hello Joe!"
}
```


`/hello?name=Stan`
```json
{
    "msg":"Hello Stan!"
}
```

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "encoding/json"](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/)

### 3.5. Web Addition

Create an API end point that accepts two numbers, adds then, and outputs the result.

For example:

`/addition?x=3&y=2`
```
{
    "result":"5",
}
```

Hints:
* [strconv.ParseInt()](https://golang.org/pkg/strconv/#ParseInt)
* [strconv.ParseUint()](https://golang.org/pkg/strconv/#ParseUint)
* [import "encoding/json"](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/)

## 4. Database

### 4.1. Install the Postgres Database Server

### 4.2. Create a Database

Use the Postgres command line tool `psql` to create a new database.

### 4.3. Create a Table

Use the Postgres command line tool `psql` to create a new table (in the database you previously created).

Your table should include a field that is its _primary key_:
```
id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
```

And it should include a field named `when_created`:
```sql
when_created TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
```

Of course, you should have other fields besides this one. Make up some type of table. And include fields that make sense for your made up table.

### 4.4. INSERT

Use the Postgres command line tool `psql` to INSERT some new values (into the new table you created in the new database you previously created).

## 5. Database & Go

### 5.1. Browse

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and gets and outputs all the data your from the table you previously created.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* [Go "database/sql" tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)

### 5.2. Read

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and gets a single row from the table you previously created.

Use a variable to specify the ID of the row you want to get. For example:
```Go
var id int64 = 123
```

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* [Go "database/sql" tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)

### 5.3. Create

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and creates a single row from the table you previously created.

**Your program needs to also output the PRIMARY KEY of the row you just created.**

(Note that there is a trick to getting the PRIMARY KEY of the INSERTed row using Postgres in Golang, as the `"pq"` package does NOT support `LastInsertId()`. The [pq Queries](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Queries) hint talks about how to get it using the "RETURNING id" technique.)

Use a variable to specify the ID of the row you want to get. For example:
```Go
var id int64 = 123
```

And use other variables for the fields for the row that you are creating.

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* [Go "database/sql" tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)
* [pq Queries](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Queries)

### 5.4. Update

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and updates a single row from the table you previously created.

Use a variable to specify the ID of the row you want to get. For example:
```Go
var id int64 = 123
```

And use other variables for the fields that you update.

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* [Go "database/sql" tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)

### 5.5. Delete

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and delete a single row from the table you previously created.

Use a variable to specify the ID of the row you want to get. For example:
```Go
var id int64 = 123
```

And use other variables for the fields for the row that you are creating.

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* [Go "database/sql" tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)

## 6. Option Types

### 6.1. Type

You can think of an **option types** as a _container_ that either has _nothing_ in it, or it can have _something_ in it.

Let's make an **option type** for `int64`. So that this _int64 option type_ will either have nothing in it, or will have an int64 value in it.

Make this code work:

```
type Int64Option struct {
    //@TODO
}

// Nothing returns an option with nothing in it.
func Nothing() Int64Option {
    //@TODO
}

// Something returns an option with ‘ value’ in it.
func Something(value int64) Int64Option {
    //@TODO
}

// Return returns the value it store if there is something in it, else it return an error.
func (receiver Int64Option) Return() (int64, error) {
    //@TODO
}
```

### 6.2. GoStringer

The Go [fmt.Fprintf()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Fprintf), [fmt.Printf()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Printf), and [fmt.Sprintf()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Sprintf) functions have a **flag** that lets you see the **Go-syntax representation of the value**.

To do this we use the following flag:
```
%#v
```

For example:
```
var name string = "Joe Blow"

fmt.Printf("name = %#v", name)
```
This would output:
```
name = "Rex"
```


And also, for example:
```
type Dog struct {
    Name string
}

var myDog Dog

myDog.Name = "Rex"

fmt.Printf("myDog = %#v", myDog)
```
This would output something like:
```
myDog = main.Dog{Name:"Rex"}
```

If we were to use `%#v` on your **option type** then it would try to display the struct.

Make it so that this:
```
var opt Int64Option = Nothing()

fmt.Printf("opt = %#v" , opt)
```
Outputs:
```
opt = Nothing()
```

And:
```
var opt Int64Option = Something(42)

fmt.Printf("opt = %#v" , opt)
```
Outputs:
```
opt = Something(42)
```

Etc.


Hints:
* [fmt.GoStringer](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#GoStringer)
* [fmt.Fprintf()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Fprintf)
* [fmt.Printf()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Printf)
* [fmt.Sprintf()](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Sprintf)

### 6.3. Stringer

Hints:
* [fmt.Stringer](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Stringer)

### 6.4. JSON Marshal

Make it so your **option type** can be represented as JSON as:—

For nothing:
```
"nothing()"
```

For something:
```
"something(5)"
```

Then write a program that demonstrates this being used.

Hints:
* [json.Marshaler](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshaler)
* [json.Marshal()](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshal)

### 6.5. JSON Unmarshal

Make it so your **option type** can be parse from a JSON representation of:—

For nothing:
```
"nothing()"
```

For something:
```
"something(5)"
```

Then write a program that demonstrates this being used.

Hints:
* [json.Unmarshaler](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Unmarshaler)
* [json.Unmarshal()](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Unmarshal)

### 6.6. Valuer

If you are putting data into a database in Go, then you will probably either use [database/sql.DB.Exec()](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.Exec) or [database/sql.DB.QueryRow()](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.QueryRow) (or something similar to them).

By default, these  methods will only understand basic types.

**So how do you put your own custom type into the database?**

That is what you need to figure out.

Then make it so your **option type** can put into a database.

And then write a program that INSERTs your **option type** INTO the database.

Hints:
* [database/sql/driver.Valuer](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/driver/#Valuer)
* [database/sql.DB.Exec()](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.Exec)
* [database/sql.DB.Query()](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.Query)
* [database/sql.DB.QueryRow()](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.QueryRow)

### 6.7. Scanner

If you are getting data from a database in Go, then you will probably either use [database/sql.Rows.Scan()](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#Rows.Scan) or [database/sql.Row.Scan()](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#Row.Scan) (or something similar to them).

By default, these `.Scan()` methods will scan into (a pointer to):

* string
* []byte
* int
* int8
* int16
* int32
* int64
* uint
* uint8
* uint16
* uint32
* uint64
* bool
* float32
* float64
* interface{}
* sql.RawBytes

**But how do you `.Scan()` into your own custom type?**

That is what you need to figure out.

Then make it so your **option type** can be `.Scan()`ed into.

And then write a program that scans data from the database into your **option type**.

Hints:
* [database/sql.Scanner](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#Scanner)
* [database/sql.Rows.Scan()](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#Rows.Scan)
* [database/sql.Row.Scan()](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#Row.Scan)

## 7. Money

### 7.1. Type

Create a Canadian Dollars money type, that stores the money as cents. I.e.,:
```go
type CAD struct {
    cents int64
}
```

And implement these functions:
```go
func ParseCAD(s string) (CAD, error) {
    //@TODO
}

// Abs returns the absolute value.
func (receiver CAD) Abs() CAD {
    //@TODO
}

func (receiver CAD) Add(other CAD) CAD {
    //@TODO
}

func (receiver CAD) Mul(scalar int64) CAD {
    //@TODO
}

func (receiver CAD) Sub(other CAD) CAD {
    //@TODO
}
```
