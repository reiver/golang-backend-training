# Golang Backend Training
by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

-----

With this **guide** you will learn how to do **backend development** using the Go programming language.

**This is NOT a tutorial. This is a guide that directs you to learn specific things.**

The whole point of this guide is that _you_ go and learn what you need to learn to be able to complete each assignment in this guide.

If you can accomplish all these tasks then you will have _a lot_ of the skills necessary to do **backend development** using the Go programming language.

This guide gives you hints. And you should spend a bit of time trying to figure out stuff yourself. **BUT DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME BEING STUCK. ASK FOR HELP IF YOU GET STUCK!**

## PREFACE

Do NOT skip any sections.

Do NOT skip any sections!

Do NOT skip any sections!!

**Do _all_ the sections.**

Even if they seem easy to you — still, do _all_ the sections! The point of this guide is _not_ to challenge you; the point of this guide is to help you become familiar with certain parts of Go, and to correct any mistakes or misunderstandings you might have early on.

**And do all the sections in the order that they appear in this guide.**

A particular section can depend on the knowledge gained in previous sections. You need to do them in the order they appear in this guide.

The point of you going through this guide is that, after you complete each assignment, then **you show your work to someone more experienced with the Go programming language, so that they can give you feedback, tips, etc, so you can learn Go faster**.

## 

In general you a creating a separate project for each section.

I.e., most section's code will have their own `main.go` and `go.mod` file.

For example:...

* `chapter1/`
  * `section1.1/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.4/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.5/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.6/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.7/`
    * `cfg.go`
    * `go.mod`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.8/`
    * `cfg.go`
    * `formletter.go`
    * `go.mod`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.8/`
    * `cfg/` 
      * `cfg.go`
    * `go.mod`
    * `lib/`
      * `formletter.go`
    * `main.go`
* `chapter2/`
  * `section2.1/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `main.go`
  * ... etc etc etc ...
* ... etc etc etc ...
