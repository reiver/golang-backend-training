## 9. Database & Go ([Golang Backend Training](../../README.md))

### 9.1. Browse

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and gets and outputs all the data your from the table you previously created.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* [Go "database/sql" tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)

### 9.2. Read

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and gets a single row from the table you previously created.

Use a variable to specify the ID of the row you want to get. For example:
```Go
var id int64 = 123
```

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* [Go "database/sql" tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)

### 9.3. Create

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and creates a single row from the table you previously created.

**Your program needs to also output the PRIMARY KEY of the row you just created.**

(Note that there is a trick to getting the PRIMARY KEY of the INSERTed row using Postgres in Golang, as the `"pq"` package does NOT support `LastInsertId()`. The [pq Queries](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Queries) hint talks about how to get it using the "RETURNING id" technique.)

Use a variable to specify the ID of the row you want to get. For example:
```Go
var id int64 = 123
```

And use other variables for the fields for the row that you are creating.

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* [Go "database/sql" tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)
* [pq Queries](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-Queries)

### 9.4. Update

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and updates a single row from the table you previously created.

Use a variable to specify the ID of the row you want to get. For example:
```Go
var id int64 = 123
```

And use other variables for the fields that you update.

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* [Go "database/sql" tutorial](http://go-database-sql.org/)

### 9.5. Delete

Write a Go program that connects to the database server you previously installed and delete a single row from the table you previously created.

Use a variable to specify the ID of the row you want to get. For example:
```Go
var id int64 = 123
```

And use other variables for the fields for the row that you are creating.

Also include logging.

Hints:
* [import "database/sql"](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
* [import _ "github.com/lib/pq"](https://github.com/lib/pq)
