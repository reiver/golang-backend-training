You are about to get started with the Go backend training guide.

This chapter will cover some important information you need to know before you get started.

## Do It All

Do NOT skip any sections.

Do NOT skip any sections!

Do NOT skip any sections!!

**Do _all_ the sections.**

Even if they seem easy to you — still, do _all_ the sections! The point of this guide is _not_ to challenge you; the point of this guide is to help you become familiar with certain parts of Go, and to correct any mistakes or misunderstandings you might have early on.

## Do It In Order

**And do all the sections in the order that they appear in this guide.**

A particular section can depend on the knowledge gained in previous sections. You need to do them in the order they appear in this guide.

## Coaching

The point of you going through this guide is that, after you complete each assignment, then **you show your work to someone more experienced with the Go programming language, so that they can give you feedback, tips, etc, so you can learn Go faster**.

## Files and Directories

As you read through this **guide**, you will be writing code.

In general you are creating a separate project for each section.

I.e., most section's code will have their own `main.go`, `go.mod`, and `go.sum` files.

For example, **you** might create a directory structure like this for your code...

* `chapter1/`
  * `section1.1/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `go.sum`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.4/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `go.sum`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.5/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `go.sum`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.6/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `go.sum`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.7/`
    * `cfg.go`
    * `go.mod`
    * `go.sum`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.8/`
    * `cfg.go`
    * `formletter.go`
    * `go.mod`
    * `go.sum`
    * `main.go`
  * `section1.8/`
    * `cfg/` 
      * `cfg.go`
    * `go.mod`
    * `go.sum`
    * `lib/`
      * `formletter.go`
    * `main.go`
* `chapter2/`
  * `section2.1/`
    * `go.mod`
    * `go.sum`
    * `main.go`
  * ... etc etc etc ...
* ... etc etc etc ...
